## 🌟 Overview
This project is a learning-focused replica of an e-commerce clothing store template built by [Hamza Naeem](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1273571982885059508/e-commerce-website-template-freebie), featuring user profile management and sign-in/sign-up functionality. It was designed to help me practice building dynamic and user-friendly web applications.

This project was developed as a self-educational initiative to enhance my skills in NextJS, Drizzle-ORM and Jest.
